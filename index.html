	The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down it wasn't the same
<br>
I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
<br>
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth
Call you a bitch and leave?
<br>
Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?
What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?
<br>
I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
<br>
Don't hold your breath, forget you've ever saw me at my best
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had
<br>
I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
